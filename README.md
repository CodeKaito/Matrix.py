# A Matrix Rain Animation in Python

This Python code creates a simple animation in which green characters fall vertically down a black screen, resembling the code rain from the movie "The Matrix". 

## Prerequisites

- `pygame` module should be installed (use command `pip install pygame`)
- A font file `MSMINCHO.ttf` should be present in the working directory (can be replaced with any font file of your choice)

## Usage

Simply run the code in a Python editor or command line to start the animation. The animation will continue running until closed.

### Customization

The animation parameters can be customized by changing the following variables:

- `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`: width and height of the screen in pixels
- `FONT_SIZE`: size of the characters in pixels
- `alpha_value`: transparency of the background surface (0 to 255)
- `chars`: list of characters used for the animation
- `clock.tick(60)`: change the value to adjust the animation speed (higher values = faster animation)

Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different effects or add new features.
